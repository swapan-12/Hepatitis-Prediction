# Hepatitis-Prediction

# Introduction

Accurate identification is necessary for medical diagnosis, which is a crucial and intricate process.
It is essential to receive a timely diagnosis of the disease and to receive prompt treatment.
The vital organ of the human body is the liver.
Hepatitis, which causes liver inflammation, is one of the severe diseases that impair liver function.
The primary objective of this work is to conduct a comparative study on a particular dataset by training the same dataset with various machine learning (ML) tools and selecting the best tools for hepatitis disease diagnosis.

# Hepatitis Disease prediction using 3 algorithms
For the purpose of diagnosing hepatitis, various machine-learning methods were utilized in this work.
The best method for diagnosing hepatitis was determined by comparing the accuracy of various ML for a specific data set.
To accurately predict the disease, we have utilized Decision, K Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Logistic Regression.
Based on the results of this study, it can be deduced that, in terms of performance, the most accurate model is a Decision tree, with a good prediction accuracy of 80% and a minimum mean square error.
The same will be done with RNN in future work to predict the occurrence of other diseases.

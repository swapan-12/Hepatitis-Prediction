# Hepatitis-Prediction<br />

# Introduction<br />

* Accurate identification is necessary for medical diagnosis, which is a crucial and intricate process.<br />
* It is essential to receive a timely diagnosis of the disease and to receive prompt treatment.<br />
* The vital organ of the human body is the liver.<br />
* Hepatitis, which causes liver inflammation, is one of the severe diseases that impair liver function.<br />
* The primary objective of this work is to conduct a comparative study on a particular dataset by training the same dataset with various machine learning (ML) tools and selecting the best tools for hepatitis disease diagnosis.<br />

# Hepatitis Disease prediction using 3 algorithms<br />
* For the purpose of diagnosing hepatitis, various machine-learning methods were utilized in this work.<br />
* The best method for diagnosing hepatitis was determined by comparing the accuracy of various ML for a specific data set.<br />
* To accurately predict the disease, we have utilized Decision, K Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Logistic Regression.<br />
* Based on the results of this study, it can be deduced that, in terms of performance, the most accurate model is a Decision tree, with a good prediction accuracy of 80% and a minimum mean square error.<br />
* The same will be done with RNN in future work to predict the occurrence of other diseases.
